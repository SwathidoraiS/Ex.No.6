# Ex.No.6 Development of Python Code Compatible with Multiple AI Tools

# Register no : 212223040220
## Aim:
Write and implement Python code that integrates with multiple AI tools to automate the task of interacting with APIs, comparing outputs, and generating actionable insights with Multiple AI Tools

## AI Tools Required:
This project needs AI tools to generate code, compare API outputs, and give insights.
Students must use at least two different AI tools.

## Explanation:
Experiment the persona pattern as a programmer for any specific applications related with your interesting area. 
Generate the outoput using more than one AI tool and based on the code generation analyse and discussing that. 

## Objective

The purpose of this activity is to help learners design effective prompts for AI tools so they can assist in coding tasks such as:
Generating Python code
Integrating with APIs
Comparing outputs from multiple AI systems
Producing meaningful insights

## 1. Prompt for API Integration Code 

Act as a Senior Python Developer.
Write Python code that interacts with two different text-generation APIs:
1. OpenAI API
2. HuggingFace Inference API

The code must:
- Accept an input prompt
- Send the text to both APIs
- Collect both outputs
- Display results clearly
- Include exception handling
- Add sufficient comments
- Use the 'requests' library for HuggingFace

After generating the code, explain it.

## AI-Generated Code 

```
import openai
import requests

# -------------------------
# Configure API Keys
# -------------------------
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
HF_API_TOKEN = "YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN"

# HuggingFace API URL
hf_url = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/gpt2"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {HF_API_TOKEN}"
}

# -------------------------
# Function to call OpenAI
# -------------------------
def call_openai(prompt):
    try:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
        )
        return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
    except Exception as e:
        return f"OpenAI Error: {str(e)}"


# -------------------------
# Function to call HuggingFace
# -------------------------
def call_huggingface(prompt):
    try:
        payload = {"inputs": prompt}
        response = requests.post(hf_url, headers=headers, json=payload)
        data = response.json()
        
        if isinstance(data, list):
            return data[0]["generated_text"]
        return str(data)
    except Exception as e:
        return f"HuggingFace Error: {str(e)}"


# -------------------------
# Main Execution
# -------------------------
if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_prompt = "Explain Artificial Intelligence in one paragraph."

    print("\n--- OpenAI Response ---")
    print(call_openai(user_prompt))

    print("\n--- HuggingFace Response ---")
    print(call_huggingface(user_prompt))
```
## AI Explanation

The code interacts with two APIs: OpenAI and HuggingFace.
Both functions wrap API calls in try/except blocks.
A unified user_prompt is processed by both models.
Outputs are printed separately for comparison.

## 2. Prompt for Comparing Outputs
Compare the two outputs generated by the APIs.
Highlight differences in tone, clarity, detail, and accuracy.
Present the comparison in a table format.

## AI-Generated Comparison Table

| Feature  | OpenAI Output        | HuggingFace Output   | Difference                     |
| -------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Detail   | Detailed, structured | Short, limited       | OpenAI provides richer content |
| Clarity  | Clear, human-like    | Sometimes repetitive | OpenAI is clearer              |
| Accuracy | More correct         | Basic / generic      | OpenAI more accurate           |
| Tone     | Professional         | Casual               | Tone differs noticeably        |

## 3. Prompt for Insights & Next Steps

Based on the comparison, give actionable insights.
Identify which API is best for academic documentation and why.
Suggest suitable use cases for each API.

## AI-Generated Insights

OpenAI API is better for academic work because it:

✔ Produces logically structured content
✔ Offers clearer explanations
✔ Handles context better

HuggingFace GPT-2 is useful for:

✔ Creative text generation
✔ Autocomplete
✔ Local/offline inference

## Reflection Note

The first prompt I wrote was too general, and the AI gave incomplete code.
After refining the prompt and adding a persona-based instruction (“Act as a Senior Python Developer”), the output became more accurate and readable.

I learned that:
Well-structured prompts give better results
Breaking tasks into smaller stages helps
Output formatting improves when instructions are specific
I will continue to refine prompts with clearer steps and constraints.

# Result:
The corresponding Prompt is executed successfully.
